## Approach

I started this project by reading through the project's brief.

After understanding the requirements of the project, I sketched the layout and flow of the application.

Next, I jumped into figma to implement my the sketch and came up with a prototype of how the end product should look.

Using React library, I implemented the prototype as well as integrated a third-party library such as Mapbox for rendering locations on the map.

`Design Pattern and Architecture`

- `Folder Structure`: I used the 7-in-one folder structure achictecture to organise files and folders to ensure easy access and navigation within the project as well as set standards for future modifications.

- `Naming conventions`: Followed the BEM guidelines for naming my css class.

## Status

In progress
